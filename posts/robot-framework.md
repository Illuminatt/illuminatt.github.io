## How to install robot framework on your windows machine

Robot-framework is a test-automating tool which is based on Python language.

Here will be described how to start automating your test-cases for web-pages using this mighty framework.

Sadly robot-framework is still not working with Python 3.6.0 for web-page testing so first of all you need to install Python 2.7 and pip.

1. Install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation also check the box to install python in PATH.

2. Install an alternative tool for command line - [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/). It has more adaptive design and tabs!
3. Open ConEmu and print "python"

    If you see the following message:

        ```python
        Python 2.7.13 (v2.7.13:a06454b1afa1, Dec 17 2016, 20:42:59) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>>
        ```
        
    it means that python was installed correctly.
